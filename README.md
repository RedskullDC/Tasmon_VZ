This is a port of the TASMON debugger program to the VZ200/300/Laser computer


# 28-SEP-20

Initial check-in.

Source currently re-assembles to match existing TRS-80 version 2.22 for the Model 1.

VZ version will require 16K mem, and assemble @ 8000h.

NOT working on VZ/LASER as yet. Eary days!

Use DOSbox to assemble.

# 07-OCT-20

Now compiles for TRS-80 Model #1, VZ200/300/LASER, and also LASER_FPGA 64x32 screen mode.

Keyboard read still not working 100%, just added a delay kludge for the moment.

Disk/Tape load/save not yet supported.
<G> command not working.

Most other functions are working, though not tested thoroughly
